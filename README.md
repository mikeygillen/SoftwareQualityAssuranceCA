##Test Coverage Metric
Test coverage is defined as a metric in Software Testing that measures the amount of testing performed by a set of test. It will include gathering information about which parts of a program are executed when running the test suite to determine which branches of conditional statements have been taken.
InteliJ allows you to run test with coverage which can be added as a plugin.
1. Make sure that you have created the necessary run/debug configuration for your tests.
You can also run the necessary tests to generate a temporary run configuration that you can later modify and save.
2. Select the correct configuration in the list on the toolbar and select Run then Run ... with Coverage from the main menu.

3. InteliJ will then prompt you to select whether you want to replace the active coverage suites, add the collected data to the active suites, or not to apply coverage data.
Select whether you want to append the results of multiple runs and click OK.
