## Unit testing and Test-Driven development

Unit Testing involves testing individual units of behaviour. An individual unit of behaviour is the smallest possible unit of behaviour that can be individually tested in isolation.

*Test-driven development (TDD)* is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. TDD involves letting your tests drive your development. You can do that with unit tests, functional tests and acceptance tests. The most important part of TDD is the driven part, the tests will tell you what to do, what to do next, and when you are done. 

The following sequence of steps is generally followed:
* Add a test
* Run all tests and see if the new one fails
* Write some code
* Run tests
* Refactor code
* Repeat
